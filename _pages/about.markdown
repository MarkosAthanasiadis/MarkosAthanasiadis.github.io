Hey there! I'm a physicist with doctorate studies in computational neuroscience from the University of Munich (LMU) and the University of Freiburg. There I developed a versatile ML framework that tackles the black-box problem of classification algorithms, as well as neuro-inspired learning algorithms. The framework integrates advanced techniques from diverse areas, such as computer vision, and applies them to the field of neuroscience. Bridging these disciplines enables more comprehensive analysis and innovative research while fostering new insights and advancements in our understanding of the human brain.

Before diving into this exciting Ph.D. journey, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree, focusing on NanoBioPhysics from the Technical University of Dresden. There I specialized in the fabrication of bio-sensors and 3D-printed flexible brain implants with multimodal functionality. This unique blend of experiences has given me a diverse skill set and a passion for innovative technology.

When I'm not immersed in the world of AI and Data Sciences, you'll find me exploring cuisines from different countries, hiking in the Saxon Switzerland Mountains, or swimming to my heart's content.
